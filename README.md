# PracticeProjects

Repository used for all source code and projects that are created purely for practicing concepts or learning the language in general. All actual projects are to be stored in their own separate repository.

***NOTE***: This will most likely hold a lot of project files for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.
